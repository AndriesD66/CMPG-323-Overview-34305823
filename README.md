# CMPG 323 Overview 34305823
# Project and Repository context
* Each project will have its own repository
* Each repository will contain all the work for that project

# Branching strategy
* Each project will have a main branch
* Each project may have one or more additional branches, which will be used during development. The name of each branch will relate to what work will be done in the branch. For example, a branch named 'Log In' will contain the work done to create a login function
* These additional branches will be merged to the main branch once the work they contain is complete
